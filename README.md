# Credit Card Fraud Analysis

This project involves conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a credit card transaction dataset to uncover patterns and characteristics associated with fraudulent activity. The insights gained from this analysis can be crucial for refining fraud detection systems, improving risk management, and implementing targeted prevention strategies.

## Project Description

The project focuses on understanding the underlying patterns within credit card transaction data to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities. Key aspects of the analysis include:

* **Distribution Analysis:** Analyzing the distribution of transaction amounts, identifying outliers, and determining the overall fraud rate.
* **Temporal Pattern Analysis:** Investigating how fraud varies across different times of the day, days of the week, and months.
* **Geographic Analysis:** Examining fraud rates across different geographical locations, such as states and cities.
* **Categorical Analysis:** Identifying transaction categories and other categorical variables (e.g., job type) that exhibit higher fraud rates.
* **Demographic Analysis:** Analyzing fraud patterns based on demographic factors like age groups.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Determining the correlation between transaction amounts and the occurrence of fraud.
* **Class Imbalance Handling:** Addressing the imbalance in the dataset, where non-fraudulent transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones.

## Key Findings

The exploratory data analysis revealed several important insights:

* The distribution of transaction amounts is right-skewed, with high-value outliers.
* The overall fraud rate in the dataset is approximately 12.77%.
* Fraud occurrence varies temporally, with certain times of the day and months showing higher fraud rates.
* Fraud rates exhibit significant variation across different states and cities.
* Specific transaction categories and job types are associated with higher fraud rates.
* Certain age groups may be more susceptible to credit card fraud.
* A strong correlation exists between transaction amounts and the likelihood of fraud.
* The dataset is characterized by class imbalance, with a disproportionately large number of non-fraudulent transactions.
